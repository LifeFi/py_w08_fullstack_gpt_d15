The query for research about the "XZ backdoor" has yielded several points of information:

1. A backdoor was added to XZ Utils versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 that modified how the software functions. Specifically, it manipulated `sshd`, which is the executable file used for establishing remote secure connections using the SSH protocol. This backdoor may be utilized for various nefarious purposes, including but not limited to user authentication circumvention, unauthorized encryption, terminal connections, file transfers, and tunneling.

2. CVE-2024-3094 is a vulnerability that has been discovered in the open-source library XZ Utils. This vulnerability came into existence due to malicious code being pushed into the library by one of its maintainers. Initially, it was reported as an SSH authentication bypass backdoor, but further analysis suggests that it also enables remote code execution.

3. There is ongoing analysis, mapping, and infographic development related to the XZ backdoor. This includes detailed studies such as [WIP] XZ Backdoor Analysis, symbol mapping, and related resources like a honeypot setup (xzbot), and an exploit demonstration for the XZ backdoor. 

4. There's also a mention of an SSH attack shell script associated with the XZ attack and efforts to include the vulnerable version of XZ Utils in the Debian repository, as indicated by the request opened by an individual named Hans.
