From the search results, it seems that pip, the package installer for Python, is updated regularly with a new version every 3 months. The search results did not directly state the latest version of pip. However, they provided general instructions on how to update pip to the latest version on various systems.

For instance, you can update pip to the latest version using the following command:

```sh
pip install --upgrade pip
```

And on Windows, you can upgrade pip by opening the command prompt and running:

```sh
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

If you are looking for the exact latest version number of pip, it would be best to visit the official documentation or the Python Package Index (PyPI) where pip's latest releases are listed. Would you like me to try obtaining the latest version number directly from the official sources?
