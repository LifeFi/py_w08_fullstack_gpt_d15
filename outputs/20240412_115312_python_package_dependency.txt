Running the python main.py command produces the following output.. The example lists the dependencies of the requests package but you can call the function with any other package name. # Generating a pip requirements.txt file based on your imports If you need to generate a pip requirements.txt file based on the imports in your project, use the pipreqs module. With the virtual environment activated, install packages as usual with pip, To exit the virtual environment: pip install package_name deactivate Manage Python Dependencies Using Pipenv. Pipenv is a higher-level tool that simplifies dependency management and adds functionality like a Pipfile for package specification. Step 1: Install Pipenv pipdeptree. pipdeptree is a command line utility for displaying the installed python packages in form of a dependency tree. It works for packages installed globally on a machine as well as in a virtualenv. Since pip freeze shows all dependencies as a flat list, finding out which are the top level packages and which packages do they depend on requires some effort. A ramified 'Python' in the shape of a dependency graph. Drawing by author. Dependency graphs. In terms of data structure, rather than a labyrinth, we are talking about a dependency graph, that is a network where nodes represent packages and are interlinked through directed edges representing dependencies. Abstract. This PEP specifies the language used to describe dependencies for packages. It draws a border at the edge of describing a single dependency - the different sorts of dependencies and when they should be installed is a higher level problem. The intent is to provide a building block for higher layer specifications.
