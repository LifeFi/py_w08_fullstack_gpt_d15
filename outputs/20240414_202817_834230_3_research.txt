Below are the extracted texts from the Wikipedia pages on pencil cases, colored pencils, and pencils:

**Pencil case:**
A pencil case or pencil box is a container used to store pencils. A pencil case can also contain a variety of other stationery such as sharpeners, pens, glue sticks, erasers, scissors, and rulers. Pencil cases can be made from a variety of materials such as wood or metal. Some pencil cases have a hard and rigid shell encasing the pens inside, while others use a softer material such as plastic, leather, or cotton. Soft versions are typically fastened with a zipper. Early pencil cases were round or cylindrical in shape. Some early pencil cases were decorated with jasper (one from 1860) or platinum (from 1874). The first recorded instance of a pencil case being used was in congress in 1858 by Augustus C. Dodge.

**Colored pencil:**
A colored pencil is an art medium constructed of a narrow, pigmented core encased in a wooden cylindrical case. Unlike graphite and charcoal pencils, colored pencils' cores are wax- or oil-based and contain varying proportions of pigments, additives, and binding agents. Water-soluble (watercolor) pencils and pastel pencils are also manufactured as well as colored cores for mechanical pencils. Colored pencils are made in a wide range of price, quality, and usability, from student-grade to professional-grade. Factors such as concentration of pigments in the core, lightfastness of the pigments, durability of the colored pencil, and softness of the core are determinants of a brand's quality and market price. Colored pencils are commonly stored in pencil cases to prevent damage.

**Pencil:**
A pencil is a writing or drawing implement with a solid pigment core in a protective casing that reduces the risk of core breakage and keeps it from marking the user's hand. Pencils create marks by physical abrasion, leaving a trail of solid core material that adheres to a sheet of paper or other surface. They are distinct from pens, which dispense liquid or gel ink onto the marked surface. Most pencil cores are made of graphite powder mixed with a clay binder. Graphite pencils produce grey or black marks that are easily erased but otherwise resistant to moisture, most solvents, ultraviolet radiation, and natural aging. Other types of pencil cores, such as those of charcoal, are mainly used for drawing and sketching. Colored pencils are sometimes used by teachers or editors to correct submitted texts, but are typically regarded as art supplies.
