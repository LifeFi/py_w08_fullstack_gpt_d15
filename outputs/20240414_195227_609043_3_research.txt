코파일럿에 대해서 조사해줘

I found some information about GitHub Copilot from Wikipedia:

GitHub Copilot is a code completion tool developed by GitHub (owned by Microsoft) and OpenAI (49% owned by Microsoft) that assists users of Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Neovim, and JetBrains integrated development environments (IDEs) by autocompleting code. It is currently available by subscription to individual developers and businesses. The generative artificial intelligence software was first announced by GitHub on 29 June 2021, and works best for users coding in Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, and Go. In March 2023, GitHub announced plans for "Copilot X," which will incorporate a chatbot based on GPT-4 as well as support for voice commands, into Copilot.

This tool is related to GitHub, a developer platform for code storage and management, and also to GPT-4, a multimodal large language model created by OpenAI, which includes a paid chatbot product ChatGPT Plus, via OpenAI's API, and the free chatbot Microsoft Copilot. 

Note that GitHub Copilot leverages the capabilities of GPT-4, which uses a transformer-based model for natural language understanding and generation. GPT-4 was launched on March 14, 2023, and is the latest in the series of GPT models developed by OpenAI.

If you are looking for more detailed information or additional resources, please let me know, and I can assist further.
