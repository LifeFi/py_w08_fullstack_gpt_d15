The MapleStory probability manipulation incident refers to Nexon Korea Corp's alleged misconduct in altering the probability structure of in-game items called 'Cubes'. The company is accused of changing the drop odds without informing the players, which is a form of misleading customers. Cubes are items that players purchase, costing approximately $1.6 each, to draw for their desired in-game items through a gacha mechanism.

Key points about the incident include:

- Nexon Korea Corp was fined approximately $8.8 million by the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) for this probability manipulation.
- The incident pertains to the period before 2016 when there was no legal obligation to disclose the odds of probability-based items.
- It was discovered that the manipulation had been ongoing for over ten years, causing an uproar among the MapleStory community in 2021.
- Although fined, it was noted that Nexon made an estimated $42 million from Cube transactions during the period between September 2010 and March 2021.
- Nexon had to publish a probability chart for these items in March 2021.
- In January 2024, Nexon was fined by Korea's Federal Trade Committee for the manipulation and for violating E-commerce laws.

This manipulation incident is significant since it affected the in-game economy and the trust of the players in the fairness of the MapleStory game.
