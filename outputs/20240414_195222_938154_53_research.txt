Based on the search results, DuckDuckGo has recently been focusing on expanding its privacy-focused portfolio with the release of a companion web browser for Windows. It previously released a Mac version in public beta in 2022. The search results also mention that DuckDuckGo's browser is now available in beta for Windows computers and that it has introduced a new Sync & Backup feature allowing users to privately sync information like bookmarks and saved passwords across devices.

Unfortunately, specific version numbers or more detailed information about DuckDuckGo's offerings have not been provided. If you need more detailed information, I can initiate a search for the text content of specific websites related to DuckDuckGo's latest version. Would you like me to do that?
